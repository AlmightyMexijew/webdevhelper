        <h1>The Element Guide: What are our options?</h1>
        <p>Due to the sheer vastness of options available in HTML and CSS, I have created this page (which will perhaps grow to a full on site) with the understanding that it would be simpler to have a list of properties and options for our elements.</p>
        <p>The idea came in part because of my experience with flexbox and in part because of my frustration with understanding images beyond the simple insertion. This will help for those moments when it's not so clear what we do with the elements after we put them in.</p>
