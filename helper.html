            <!--Option 1:Focal Point-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Focal Point</h1>
                <p>This is the center of interest. The location to which the eye is drawn on a page. It's where things meet or diverge.</p>
                <p>There is the "rule of thirds" which helps with identifying this. Divide the canvas into 3 equal 3rds horizontally and vertically. Place the subject on those lines.</p>
                <p>By centering a majority of the subject on the meeting point of the lines, it sets a focal point.</p>

            <!--Option 2:White Space-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>White Space</h1>
                <p>White space are "quiet areas" of visual rest which give other elements room to breathe.</p>
                <p>White space does not have to be completely empty or white. The point is to have room between more "heavy" visual parts. A picture of a cliff-side has the ocean and sky as it's white space. There one can place some navigation or elements within reason.</p>

            <!--Option 3:Hierarchy-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Hierarchy</h1>
                <p>Give priority to the most important elements. This will help the reader orient themselves and lead them through the journey.</p>
                <p>Headlines tend to be more prominent than body copy. Imagery can be center-stage or blend into the background depending on your intent.</p>
                <p>The goal is to have the important stuff capture the most attention. A big dramatic picture on one page and a big dramatic caption followed by a small-font article and smaller picture would be an example of this.</p>

            <!--Option 4:Grouping-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Grouping</h1>
                <p>Instead of spacing elements out evenly, gather things that belong together. This helps readers to make sense of the information.</p>
                <p>In the example, the artist's name in big font above the photo that dominates the page. At the bottom are time/date and ticketing info.</p>

            <!--Option 5:Scale-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Scale</h1>
                <p>Employ contrasts in size to add drama. A dramatic difference in sizes can lead to dramatic effect that is both visually pleasing and attention-grabbing.</p>

            <!--Option 6:Sequence-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Sequence</h1>
                <p>Try to think of a webpage and how the user's scrolling. Panels shouldn't be in isolation but part of a sequence which is almost cinematic as an experience.</p>
                <p>Set things up to tell the big story piece by piece</p>
                <!--Checkbox, which will be added to collected total for a score displayed later-->
            <!--Option 7:Alignment-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Alignment</h1>
                <p>Be deliberate with vertical axes. Be attentive to horizontal axes too. Responsive layouts mean each screen size should be catered to and checked carefully.</p>
                <p>Alignment that looks random also looks amateurish.  </p>
                <!--Checkbox, which will be added to collected total for a score displayed later-->
            <!--Option 8:Balance-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Balance</h1>
                <p>Use counter-balancing elements to distribute "visual weight". Don't rely solely on centered alignment: that is good for short sections of text.</p>
                <p>Text should be flush-left by default because it's easier to read.</p>
                <!--Checkbox, which will be added to collected total for a score displayed later-->
            <!--Option 9:Grids-->
                <!--Explanation, example-->
                <h1>Grids</h1>
                <p>Using a grid allows the achievement of all the above. A "print" layout allows margins and rows in a standardized manner that can be difficult to achieve in responsive designs.</p>
                <p>If a whole page is in view, the bottom margin should be larger than the top. When the margins are the same height it appears as if the layout is falling down off the page.</p>
